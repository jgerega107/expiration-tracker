## About the Project
Expiration Tracker offers a simple way to add food items to a virtual pantry to keep track of their expiration dates in hopes of reducing food waste. Not only does Expiration Tracker provide you with details on how long you should store food items, but it also provides you with an option to search for recipes using the food items already in your virtual pantry.
